III. How to Run the Application

III-a. Capturing Packets via Wireshark

When saving the SPDY packet, a second text file containing the decrypted bytes must also be included. This method is as follows:

(To be done before the Wireshark capture is started)
1) Open the control panel
2) Go to System -> Advanced system settings -> Environment Variables
3) Enter a new User Variable (Variable = SSLKEYLOGFILE, Value = "PATH TO THE DESKTOP" \sslkeylog.log)
4) In Wireshark go to Edit -> Preferences -> Protocols -> SSL
5) In the (Pre)-Master-Secret log filename, browse and select the sslkeylog.log file on the desktop (Firefox may need to be opened at least once before this file is created)
6) Click OK

The method to obtain working pcap files for this application are as follows:

1) Open Firefox
2) Enter 'about:config' in the url input

(HTTP)
3) Enter 'network.http.spdy.enabled.http2'
4) Make sure value is set to False
5) Enter 'security.ssl.enable_alpn'
6) Make sure value is set to False

(SPDY/HTTP2 & QUIC)
3) Enter 'network.http.spdy.enabled.http2'
4) Make sure value is set to True
5) Enter 'security.ssl.enable_alpn'
6) Make sure value is set to True

7) Open Firefox
8) Open Wireshark
9) Start packet capture
10) Load a page/video via Firefox
11) Once the page/video is loaded stop the capture in Wireshark

(HTTP)
12) Filter the packets in Wireshark to 'http'
13) Save the selected packets as http............xxxxxx.pcap

(SPDY/HTTP2)
12) Export the decrypted packets
	a. Mark each packet (ctrl+m)
	b. File -> Export Packet Dissections -> As Plain Text
	c. Check the box that says 'Marked Packets'
	d. Save file as spdy............xxxxxx.txt
13) Filter the packets in Wireshark to 'http2'
14) Save the selected packets as spdy............xxxxxx.pcap

(QUIC)
12) Filter the packets in Wireshark to 'quic'
13) Save the selected packets as quic............xxxxxx.pcap

These are to be the selected files for Browse HTTP, Browse SPDY, Browse Decrypt, and Browse Quic respectively.

III-b. Starting the Application

JAR

1) Navigate the to directory where the jar file is located
2) Enter the command "java -jar <filename>.jar"

ECLIPSE

1) Open the project
2) Click 'Run' with StartProject.java as its configure main method

III-c. Using the application

1) View HTTP packet details and calculated results
	a. Click 'Browse HTTP' button
	b. Select a HTTP pcap file from a Wireshark capture

2) View SPDY packet details and calculated results
	a. Click 'Browse Decrypt' button
	b. Select a decrypted text file from a Wireshark capture
	c. Click 'Browse SPDY' button
	d. Select a SPDY pcap file from a Wireshark capture
	
3) View QUIC packet details and calculated results
	a. Click 'Browse QUIC' button
	b. Select a QUIC pcap file from a Wireshark capture
	
4) Export Results to Excel
	a. Once all files have been initialized, click the 'Export Results' button

IV. Additional Info

1) The executable jar file for this application "packet-app.jar" can be found in the app folder
2) The python file used to graph the results "performance_eval.py" can be found in the evaluation folder
